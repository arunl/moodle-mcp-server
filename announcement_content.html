<p>Dear Students,</p>

<p>I am truly impressed by the level of enthusiasm and engagement you have shown on the Self-Introduction Forum! Reading through your introductions, I was struck by the diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and aspirations in our class. It's clear that we have an exceptional group of students this semester, and I'm excited to see the collaborative work you will accomplish together.</p>

<h3>Forum Activity Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>35 students</strong> posted their self-introductions</li>
<li><strong>30 students</strong> actively engaged by responding to classmates</li>
<li><strong>70+ replies</strong> were exchanged across all discussions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Timeliness Snapshot</h3>
<p>As you know, one of the key factors in team compatibility is how members respond to deadlines. Here's how the class performed on this first activity:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Category</th><th>Count</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Early Finishers</strong></td><td>21</td><td>Posted 24+ hours before the deadline</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>On-Time Finishers</strong></td><td>10</td><td>Posted within 24 hours of the deadline</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Late Finishers</strong></td><td>4</td><td>Posted after the original deadline (used extension)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Non-Finishers</strong></td><td>5</td><td>Did not post</td></tr>
</table>

<p>As you form your teams, consider discussing your work styles and how you approach deadlines. Teams work best when members have compatible expectations about timing and commitment.</p>
